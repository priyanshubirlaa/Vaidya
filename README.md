## 🌟 Introduction

Vaidya is a cutting-edge healthcare management system built on *Spring Boot* with a microservices architecture. Named after the Sanskrit word for "physician" (वैद्य), Vaidya streamlines patient-doctor interactions through five vibrant, interconnected services: user authentication, appointment scheduling, prescription management, user administration, and slot allocation. 🎉 It’s designed for scalability, security, and ease of use, leveraging RESTful APIs to deliver a seamless healthcare experience.


## 🛠 Architecture Overview

Vaidya’s microservices communicate via REST APIs, orchestrated through a lightweight API Gateway. Dive into the high-level architecture below:
